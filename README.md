# spam-email-detection

The notebook focuses on building an "Email Spam Detection" system using machine learning. Here is a brief explanation of the key steps:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the email data by converting text into a format suitable for modeling. This includes techniques like removing unnecessary characters, tokenizing words, and converting text into numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to understand the distribution of spam and non-spam emails, using visualizations and statistical methods.

Feature Extraction: Transform the text data into numerical features using methods like TF-IDF or word embeddings to capture the importance of words in each email.

Model Building: Train machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to classify emails as spam or not spam.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine how well they identify spam emails.

Final Model: Select the best-performing model, possibly tuning its parameters for optimal performance in spam detection.

Conclusion: Summarize the effectiveness of the chosen model and suggest potential improvements for future work.
